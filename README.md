# Highly Composite
The problem we're trying to solve is how hard it is for junior software engineers to contribute. How we'll do that is [unsure](https://github.com/highlycomposite/highlycomposite/wiki/Roadmap). Here's how [you can help](https://github.com/highlycomposite/highlycomposite/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

### [Setup](/docs/setup.md) 

### [Running](/docs/running.md)

### [Testing](/docs/testing.md)

### Deployment
The master branch autodeploys to a Heroku [staging environment](https://highly-composite-staging.herokuapp.com/). Production doesn't exist (yet). New PRs automatically create a review app. Here's the full [deployment list](https://github.com/highlycomposite/highlycomposite/deployments).
